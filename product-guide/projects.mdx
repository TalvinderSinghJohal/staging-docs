> **Note:**  
> For more detail on individual guardrails, refer to the [Guardrail Configuration Guide](/product-guide/policies).

#### 3.2 Configure Response

1. Set response parameters to guide the LLM’s behavior.
2. These configurations determine tone, scope, or fallback responses depending on your use case.
