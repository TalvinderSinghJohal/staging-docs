## Overview

The **Guardrail Configuration** module enables users and administrators to define and manage responsible AI guardrails across projects. This ensures alignment with compliance, security, and ethical standards using AltrumAI's flexible and intuitive configuration system.

---

## Accessing Guardrail Configuration

1. From the **Home Page**, select your AI System to open the **AI System Dashboard**.
2. Click the **Edit Guardrails** button to begin editing your guardrails.

### Step 1: Select a Guardrail

- Click on a guardrail from the list on the left.
- The selected guardrail's configuration options will appear on the right-hand panel.

### Step 2: Configure the Guardrail

Each guardrail has its own set of configuration options. Common configuration steps include:

- **Enable the Guardrail** using the toggle at the top of the panel.
- Choose an **Enforcement Mode**:
  - **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
  - **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- Adjust **Thresholds** (if applicable).
- Select and Configure relevant **Topics, Entities, Categories, or Words & Phrases** (depending on the guardrail type).

 _For detailed instructions on each guardrail type, refer to the **Guardrails** section of the documentation._

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

- Click **Save & Continue** to store your configuration.
- Your updates will now be saved to your AI System and ready to view in the Summary Page.

## Testing Guardrails

Once you've configured one or more guardrails, navigate to the **Test Configuration** Page.

This is a **sandbox environment** where you can:

- Interact with a test chatbot.
- See your configured guardrails in action.
- Observe how inputs and outputs are flagged & blocked in real time.

> **Note:**  
> This is a valuable step to validate guardrail behaviour before applying changes to a live AI System.

## Applying Configured Guardrails

When you're satisfied with your configuration and testing:

1. Review the **Summary** page where you can:
   - View all configured guardrails
   - Make additional changes if required
   - Update existing configurations
2. Once you're happy with all changes, click **View AI System** to return to the AI System Dashboard.

## Editing or Disabling Guardrails

To update or turn off a guardrail:

1. From the **AI System Dashboard**, click **Edit Guardrails** to access the Configure Guardrails page.
2. For each guardrail:
   - Toggle the **Enable** button On or Off based on your required configuration
   - Make any additional configuration changes as needed
3. Click **Save & Continue** to confirm your updates.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with **Monitor** mode to observe behavior without disruption.
- Use the **Test Guardrails** page to validate before applying changes.
- Regularly review violation logs and refine configurations as needed.
- Apply stricter enforcement to regulated or high-risk AI Systems.
