## Overview

The **Reporting** module provides real-time insights into the performance of your AI applications and the effectiveness of guardrail enforcement across your organisation and projects.

Reporting enables you to track key usage statistics, monitor guardrail adherence, and identify trends over time empowering better governance and continuous improvement.

## Accessing the Reporting Dashboard

1. From the **Navigation Panel**, click on the **Reporting** tab.
2. You will be directed to the **Reporting Page**, where you can access organisational and project level insights.

## Navigating the Reporting Page

The Reporting Page includes two tabs:

### 1. Organisation-Level Data

- View aggregated data across all projects within the organisation.
- Metrics include:
  - Overall usage statistics
  - Aggregate guardrail violation counts
  - Organisation wide trends over time

**Time Filter Options**:
- **Last 7 Days**
- **Last 30 Days**
- **Last 90 Days**
- **Year to Date**

Selecting a timeframe will automatically update the statistics and visualisations.

### 2. Project-Level Data

- View detailed metrics for individual projects.
- This tab offers an additional **Project Filter** to allow users to isolate reporting data for a specific project within the organisation.

**Time and Project Filter Options**:
- **Time Filters**: Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days, Year to Date
- **Project Filter**: Select from a list of active projects

Using both filters together allows users to:
- Compare project specific performance
- Identify where compliance efforts may need reinforcement
- Spot trends unique to individual projects

#### Detailed Guardrail Violations Logs

The **Guardrail Violation Logs** table within the Project Reporting page allows you to review all guardrail violation events for the selected project.

**New Feature:**
- You can now expand any record in the table for more details. Click the **eye icon** on a row to open a **slider panel** from the right side of the screen.
- The slider panel displays further details about the selected violation, such as:
  - Timestamp of the violation
  - Guardrail name and details of violation
  - User or system that triggered the violation
  - Input and output data (if available and permitted)
  - Request/Response Metadata

This enhancement enables deeper investigation and auditing of individual guardrail violations, helping you understand context and take appropriate action.

## Best Practices

- **Weekly Reviews**: Monitor the Reporting Dashboard weekly to ensure continuous compliance and spot early trends.
- **Use Filters Strategically**: Narrow down by project and timeframe when investigating spikes in violation activity.
- **Compare Organisation vs. Project**: Use both tabs to understand overall health versus project specific deviations.
