## Overview

The **Guardrail Configuration** module enables users and administrators to define and manage responsible AI guardrails across projects. This ensures alignment with compliance, security, and ethical standards using AltrumAI's flexible and intuitive configuration system.

---

## Accessing Guardrail Configuration

1. From the **Dashboard**, select a project to open the **Project Overview** page.
2. From here, you can either:
   - Edit an existing guardrail from the **Guardrails Table**, or
- Click the **Edit Guardrails** button to begin configuring new guardrails.

This will take you to the **Guardrail Configuration** screen, which contains three tabs:
- **Configure Guardrails**
- **Configure Response**
- **Test Guardrails**

## Configuring a Guardrail

### Step 1: Navigate to the Configure Guardrails Tab

Within the **Configure Guardrails** tab, you'll see a list of guardrails provided by AltrumAI, such as:
- Data Privacy
- Bias & Fairness
- Toxicity
- Hallucinations
- Competitor Mention
- and more

### Step 2: Select a Guardrail

- Click on a guardrail from the list on the left.
- The selected guardrail's configuration options will appear on the right-hand panel.

### Step 3: Configure the Guardrail

Each guardrail has its own set of configuration options. Common configuration steps include:

- **Enable the Guardrail** using the toggle at the top of the panel.
- Choose an **Enforcement Mode**:
  - **Log Only** – Log violations without blocking interactions.
  - **Log and Override** – Block content that violates the guardrail.
- Adjust **Sensitivity Thresholds** (if applicable).
- Select relevant **Topics, Entities, or Regulations** (depending on the guardrail type).

 _For detailed instructions on each guardrail type, refer to the **Guardrail Overview** section of the documentation._

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

- Click **Save Changes** to store your configuration.
- Your updates will now be associated with the project, but not yet active until applied.

## Testing Guardrails

Once you've configured one or more guardrails, navigate to the **Test Guardrails** tab.

This is a **sandbox environment** where you can:

- Interact with a test chatbot.
- See your configured guardrails in action.
- Observe how prompts and responses are flagged, modified, or blocked in real time.

This is a valuable step to validate guardrail behavior before applying changes to a live project.

---

## Applying Configured Guardrails

When you're satisfied with your configuration and testing:

1. Navigate to the **Integration** page.
2. If needed, retrieve your **Project API Key** from the integration settings.
3. Review the **Summary** page where you can:
   - View all configured guardrails
   - Make additional changes if required
   - Update existing configurations
4. Once you're happy with all changes, click **View Project** to return to the Project Dashboard.

---

## Editing or Disabling Guardrails

To update or turn off a guardrail:

1. From the **Project Dashboard**, click **Edit Guardrails** to access the Configure Guardrails page.
2. For each guardrail:
   - Toggle the **Enable** button On or Off based on your required configuration
   - Make any additional configuration changes as needed
3. Click **Save Changes** to confirm your updates.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with **Log Only** mode to monitor behavior without disruption.
- Use the **Test Guardrails** tab to validate before applying changes.
- Regularly review violation logs and refine configurations as needed.
- Apply stricter enforcement to regulated or high-risk projects.
