## Navigating the Reporting Page

The Reporting Page includes two tabs:

### 1. Organisation-Level Data

- View aggregated data across all projects within the organisation.
- Metrics include:
  - Overall usage statistics
  - Aggregate policy violation counts
  - Organisation wide trends over time

**Time Filter Options**:
- **Last 7 Days**
- **Last 30 Days**
- **Last 90 Days**
- **Year to Date**

Selecting a timeframe will automatically update the statistics and visualisations.

### 2. Project-Level Data

- View detailed metrics for individual projects.
- This tab offers an additional **Project Filter** to allow users to isolate reporting data for a specific project within the organisation.

**Time and Project Filter Options**:
- **Time Filters**: Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days, Year to Date
- **Project Filter**: Select from a list of active projects

Using both filters together allows users to:
- Compare project specific performance
- Identify where compliance efforts may need reinforcement
- Spot trends unique to individual projects

## Best Practices

- **Weekly Reviews**: Monitor the Reporting Dashboard weekly to ensure continuous compliance and spot early trends.
- **Use Filters Strategically**: Narrow down by project and timeframe when investigating spikes in violation activity.
- **Compare Organisation vs. Project**: Use both tabs to understand overall health versus project specific deviations.
