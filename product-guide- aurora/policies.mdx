## Overview

The **Policy Configuration** module enables users and administrators to define and manage responsible AI policies across projects. This ensures alignment with compliance, security, and ethical standards using AltrumAI's flexible and intuitive configuration system.

---

## Accessing Policy Configuration

1. From the **Dashboard**, select a project to open the **Project Overview** page.
2. From here, you can either:
   - Edit an existing policy from the **Policies Table**, or
   - Click the **Edit Policies** button to begin configuring new policies.

This will take you to the **Policy Configuration** screen, which contains three tabs:
- **Configure Policies**
- **Configure Response**
- **Test Policies**

## Configuring a Policy

### Step 1: Navigate to the Configure Policies Tab

Within the **Configure Policies** tab, you'll see a list of policies provided by AltrumAI, such as:
- Data Privacy
- Bias & Fairness
- Toxicity
- Hallucinations
- Competitor Mention
- and more

### Step 2: Select a Policy

- Click on a policy from the list on the left.
- The selected policy's configuration options will appear on the right-hand panel.

### Step 3: Configure the Policy

Each policy has its own set of configuration options. Common configuration steps include:

- **Enable the Policy** using the toggle at the top of the panel.
- Choose an **Enforcement Mode**:
  - **Log Only** – Log violations without blocking interactions.
  - **Log and Override** – Block content that violates the policy.
- Adjust **Sensitivity Thresholds** (if applicable).
- Select relevant **Topics, Entities, or Regulations** (depending on the policy type).

 _For detailed instructions on each policy type, refer to the **Policy Overview** section of the documentation._

### Step 4: Save the Configuration

- Click **Save Changes** to store your configuration.
- Your updates will now be associated with the project, but not yet active until applied.

## Testing Policies

Once you've configured one or more policies, navigate to the **Test Policies** tab.

This is a **sandbox environment** where you can:

- Interact with a test chatbot.
- See your configured policies in action.
- Observe how prompts and responses are flagged, modified, or blocked in real time.

This is a valuable step to validate policy behavior before applying changes to a live project.

## Applying Configured Policies

When you're satisfied with your configuration and testing:

1. Navigate to the **Integration** page.
2. If needed, retrieve your **Project API Key** from the integration settings.
3. Review the **Summary** page where you can:
   - View all configured policies
   - Make additional changes if required
   - Update existing configurations
4. Once you're happy with all changes, click **View Project** to return to the Project Dashboard.

---

## Editing or Disabling Policies

To update or turn off a policy:

1. From the **Project Dashboard**, click **Edit Policies** to access the Configure Policies page.
2. For each policy:
   - Toggle the **Enable** button On or Off based on your required configuration
   - Make any additional configuration changes as needed
3. Click **Save Changes** to confirm your updates.

---

## Best Practices

- Start with **Log Only** mode to monitor behavior without disruption.
- Use the **Test Policies** tab to validate before applying changes.
- Regularly review violation logs and refine configurations as needed.
- Apply stricter enforcement to regulated or high-risk projects.
