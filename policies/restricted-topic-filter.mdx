description: "Advanced topic filtering that prevents AI interactions from engaging with specified denied topics while maintaining conversation quality."
---

## Overview

This guardrail provides comprehensive protection against unwanted topics by leveraging advanced AI-powered detection systems to identify and filter conversations that involve specified denied topics. The guardrail applies sophisticated content analysis to both user inputs and AI-generated responses, ensuring that interactions remain focused, appropriate, and aligned with organizational standards.

The **Restricted Topic Filter** enables organizations to automatically detect and prevent discussions around any topics they specify by defining a comprehensive list of denied topics tailored to their specific needs. Designed with enterprise-grade accuracy and low latency, this guardrail helps ensure that AI interactions remain professional, compliant, and focused on approved subject matter.

Unlike basic keyword filtering, this guardrail employs advanced machine learning models that understand context, recognize topic variations, and accurately identify denied content even when discussed indirectly or with different terminology, providing comprehensive protection while minimizing false positives.

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Restricted Topic Filter is to maintain conversation quality and compliance by preventing AI interactions from engaging with specified denied topics while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organizations can ensure content appropriateness, maintain brand safety, prevent sensitive discussions, and uphold responsible AI usage across all interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive Topic Detection

The Restricted Topic Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **User Prompts**: Analyzes incoming user content for denied topics before processing
- **AI Responses**: Evaluates generated content for inappropriate subjects before delivery
- **Context Understanding**: Considers conversation context and topic variations for more accurate detection

#### Operational Modes

- **Log Only**: Records detected denied topics for review and analysis without blocking
- **Log and Override**: Automatically prevents denied topics from being processed or displayed

#### Threshold Sensitivity

A detection sensitivity threshold (range: **0.2 to 0.9**) allows fine-tuning of the model’s topic recognition:

- **Lower thresholds** (e.g., 0.2) are more lenient, reducing false positives.
- **Higher thresholds** (e.g., 0.9) are stricter, capturing more subtle or indirect topic violations.

### Key Features

- **Custom Topic Definition**: Define any topics that need to be restricted based on organizational needs
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Advanced understanding of conversation context and topic variations
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable detection thresholds for different use cases
- **Low Latency**: High-performance detection that doesn't impact response times
- **Enterprise-Grade Accuracy**: Minimizes false positives while maintaining high detection rates
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy addition and management of custom topics as requirements change

## How to Use the Policy

> **Note:** The steps below guide you through configuring the Topic Restriction Policy using the policy workflow interface.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Policy Workflow

1. From the **Dashboard**, open the **Project Overview** by selecting your project from the **Project Table**.
2. In the **Policy** section of the Project Overview, click **Edit Policy** to launch the policy configuration workflow.

---

### Step 2: Select and Enable the Topic Restriction Policy

1. In the **Configure Guardrails** tab, a list of available guardrails will be displayed.
2. Click on **Topic Restriction** to open its configuration options on the right-hand side of the screen.
3. Toggle the **Enable Policy** switch to **ON** to begin configuration.

---

### Step 3: Define Valid and/or Invalid Topics

1. Under the **Topic Configuration** section, you’ll find two input fields:
   - **Valid Topics** – Enter allowed topics here. Press `Enter` after each topic to add it. These will appear as tags below the input field.
   - **Invalid Topics** – Enter restricted topics here. Press `Enter` after each entry. These will also display as tags.
2. You may configure **only Valid**, **only Invalid**, or **both**, depending on your organisation's requirements.
3. Topics can be removed by clicking the “X” on any tag.

---

### Step 4: Set Application Scope

1. Under **Apply Policy To**, choose where the policy will be enforced:
   - **Prompt** – User input only
   - **Response** – AI-generated output only
   - **Both** – Enforce on both directions

---

### Step 5: Configure Enforcement Behaviour

1. Under **Behaviour**, choose how the system should respond to restricted topics:
   - **Log Only** – Flag violations without blocking the interaction.
   - **Log and Override** – Block the prompt or response and return a smart message based on your response configuration.

---

### Step 6: Adjust Detection Threshold

1. Use the **Threshold Slider** to set how strictly topics should be matched:
   - Lower values (e.g., `0.2`) allow broader interpretation and fewer false positives.
   - Higher values (e.g., `0.9`) enforce stricter topic detection and filtering.
2. The selected threshold level will be displayed numerically alongside the slider.

---

### Step 7: Save, Test, and Apply the Policy

1. Click **Save Changes** to store your configuration settings.
2. *(Optional)* Navigate to the **Test Guardrails** tab to simulate prompts and validate guardrail enforcement live.
3. Return to the **Configure Guardrails** tab and click **Apply Guardrails** to activate the configuration.
4. A success message will confirm the guardrail has been applied to your project.
