## Overview

The **Data Privacy Policy** within AltrumAI is a configurable feature designed to safeguard sensitive and regulated information during AI-driven interactions. By implementing this policy, organisations can ensure compliance with industry regulations such as **GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS**, preventing the exposure or transmission of confidential data through Language Model (LLM) interactions.
AltrumAI provides users with complete control over policy settings, allowing them to define specific data protection measures tailored to their organisational needs.

## What the Policy Does

### Purpose

The **Data Privacy Policy** ensures that sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) is neither inadvertently shared with nor generated by the AI system. By integrating this policy, organisations can:

- **Ensure compliance** with global data protection regulations.
- **Prevent data leaks** by restricting access to confidential information.
- **Monitor and control** AI-generated responses to prevent unauthorized data exposure.

### Scope

#### Prompt Configuration

Before user inputs are processed by the LLM, the Data Privacy Policy scans and manages data transmission according to the following settings:

- **Regulation Selection**  
  Users can select predefined regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) that automatically apply protective rules.

- **Operational Modes**
  - **Monitor Only** – Detects sensitive data in user inputs without blocking the request.
  - **Monitor & Override** – Prevents the transmission of prompts containing sensitive data, ensuring compliance and security.

- **Purpose**  
  Ensures that confidential data is never inadvertently shared with the AI system.

#### Response Configuration

This configuration governs how LLM-generated responses are managed before being presented to users:

- **Regulation Selection**  
  Users can apply regulations to govern how the system detects and controls sensitive content in LLM-generated responses.

- **Operational Modes**
  - **Monitor Only** – Flags AI responses that may contain sensitive information without restricting visibility.
  - **Monitor & Override** – Blocks AI-generated responses containing sensitive information, ensuring secure communication.

- **Purpose**  
  Protects end-users and organisations from receiving or distributing non-compliant or confidential information.

### Key Features

- **Predefined Regulatory Frameworks** – Seamless compliance with industry standards.
- **Real-time Monitoring & Enforcement** – Detects and prevents unauthorized data exposure dynamically.

## Why Use This Policy?

### Benefits

- **Enhances Data Security** – Prevents data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Ensures Regulatory Compliance** – Aligns AI interactions with global data protection laws.
- **Mitigates Risk** – Reduces legal and reputational risks associated with data mishandling.

## Use Case: Law Firm Compliance

### Scenario

A law firm uses AI to assist with contract drafting, legal research, and case summarisation. Given the sensitive nature of legal data, ensuring compliance with GDPR and attorney-client privilege is critical.

### Challenge

The firm must prevent confidential client information (e.g., case numbers, legal arguments, settlement amounts) from being exposed during AI interactions.

### Solution: Implementing the Data Privacy Policy

1. **Prompt Configuration**  
   GDPR and CPRA compliance rules are activated.  
   **Monitor & Override** mode is enabled to block unauthorized input transmissions.

2. **Response Configuration**  
   AI-generated responses are reviewed under **Monitor Only** mode.  
   After initial evaluation, the setting is switched to **Monitor & Override** to restrict confidential disclosures.
