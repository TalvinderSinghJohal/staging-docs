## Overview

The **Data Privacy (Custom) Policy** enables organisations to create highly tailored protections around sensitive information by selecting specific data types to monitor and manage in AI interactions. Unlike the standard Data Privacy Policy, which focuses on regulatory frameworks like GDPR or HIPAA, this version empowers users to configure protections based on custom-sensitive entities that reflect their unique compliance, operational, or industry needs.
This flexibility gives organisations granular control over what constitutes "sensitive information" allowing them to apply detection and prevention strategies across both prompts and AI-generated responses.

## What the Policy Does

### Purpose

The purpose of the Data Privacy (Custom) Policy is to protect custom-defined sensitive data by identifying and managing it in real time during LLM interactions. This policy is ideal for:

- Organisations with internal data standards not covered by regulation.
- Companies operating in niche industries with unique sensitivity requirements.
- Teams wanting full control over entity-level filtering and monitoring.

### Scope

#### Custom Entity Configuration

Users can select from a list of **52 predefined custom entities** (e.g., email addresses, passport numbers, employee IDs, passwords, customer codes) to build a custom configuration.

#### Prompt & Response Configuration

The policy can be applied to:

- **Prompts**: Preventing sensitive data from being shared with the LLM.
- **Responses**: Ensuring that sensitive information is not surfaced back to the user.

Each setting can be enabled independently to reflect business priorities.

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor Only**: Records when sensitive entities are detected but does not block the interaction.
- **Monitor & Override**: Blocks prompts or responses that contain custom-sensitive data.

### Key Features

- **52 Predefined Custom Entities**: Covers a wide range of sensitive data types.
- **Full User Control**: Select exactly which entities to monitor.
- **Independent Prompt/Response Filtering**: Tailor enforcement across the full interaction flow.
- **Flexible Enforcement Modes**: Monitor-only or full blocking.
- **Configurable to Any Environment**: Supports internal governance or industry-specific standards.

## Why Use This Policy?

### Benefits

- Delivers fine-grained control over sensitive data handling.
- Addresses data categories not covered by standard regulatory frameworks.
- Reduces the risk of exposure across niche or specialised business functions.
- Strengthens internal governance through custom configuration.

## Use Case: Global eCommerce Company

### Scenario

An international eCommerce platform uses AI to generate customer service responses, product descriptions, and marketing content. Leadership wants to ensure that personally identifiable data (e.g., account numbers, internal codes, or order IDs) is not disclosed through AI interactions.

### Challenge

The organisation needs to:

- Define sensitive data types that are not strictly regulated.
- Prevent their LLM from inadvertently generating or accepting content that includes internal identifiers.
- Enable selective enforcement depending on team and workflow.

### Solution: Implementing the Data Privacy (Custom) Policy

1. **Entity Configuration**  
   Users select from 52 predefined entities including order IDs, internal references, and contact information.

2. **Prompt & Response Filtering**  
   Enabled for both inputs and outputs.

3. **Operational Mode**  
   Initially set to **Monitor Only** for insight.  
   Switched to **Monitor & Override** after analysis reveals frequent matches.
