## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you integrate your AI application with AltrumAI AI Gateway and verify everything is working correctly. You will be able to verify the gateway integration with a simple chat completion request.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **AI Gateway enabled** and accessible in your AltrumAI platform account. This will need an AI System to be created and activated in AltrumAI platform.
- **Your API key** for at least one AI provider/platform (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, Azure AI etc.) that you are using in your AI application.
- **Basic knowledge** of REST APIs.

### Step 1: Verify Your Gateway Integration

First, let's make sure your gateway is enabled and accessible:

```bash
curl -X GET https://gateway.altrum.ai/
```

You should receive a response like:
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to the AltrumAI Gateway API! Documentation is available at https://docs.altrum.ai/ai-gateway"
}
```

### Step 2: Send Your First Request

Now let's send a simple chat completion request. This example uses OpenAI, but you can adapt it for any supported provider.

#### Basic Chat Completion

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-openai-api-key" \
  -H "x-provider-name: openai" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello! Can you tell me a joke?"
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

#### Expected Response

If everything is working correctly, you should receive a response like:

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "provider": "openai",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! ðŸ˜„"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 15,
    "total_tokens": 24
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Check Different Providers (Based on Providers you enabled for your AI System in AltrumAI platform)

Once you have confirmed the basic request works, try testing with different providers:

#### Anthropic Claude

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider-name: anthropic" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-anthropic-api-key" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is 2 + 2?"
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 50
  }'
```

#### Google Gemini

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider-name: google" \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: your-google-api-key" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemini-1.5-flash",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain quantum computing in one sentence."
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

### Step 4: Test Streaming (Optional)

Try a streaming request to see real-time responses:

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "x-provider-name: openai" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
      }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 200
  }'
```

You should see the response streaming in real-time with chunks like:

```
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1677652288,"model":"gpt-4o-mini","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Once"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: {"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1677652288,"model":"gpt-4o-mini","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" upon"},"finish_reason":null}]}

data: [DONE]
```

### Step 5: Verify Multi-Model Support

Test that you can switch between different models seamlessly:

```bash
# Test with GPT-4o
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-openai-api-key" \
  -H "x-provider-name: openai" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Solve this math problem: 15 * 23 + 7"
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 50
  }'

# Test with Claude Sonnet
curl -X POST https://gateway.altrum.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider-name: anthropic" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-anthropic-api-key" \
  -H "x-altrumai-key: your-ai-system-api-key-from-altrumai" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Solve this math problem: 15 * 23 + 7"
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 50
  }'
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Gateway Not Responding**
```bash
# Check if gateway is accessible
curl -v https://gateway.altrum.ai/

# Check for network connectivity
ping gateway.altrum.ai
```

**Authentication Errors**
- Verify your AltrumAI API key is correct
- Ensure you are using the right provider header

**Model Not Found**
- Verify the model name is correct
- Check that your API key has access to the requested model
- Ensure the AI provider supports the model you are trying to use

**Rate Limiting**
- Check your AI provider's rate & quota limits
