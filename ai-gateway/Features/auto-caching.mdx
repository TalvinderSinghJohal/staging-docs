title: Auto Caching for AI Gateway
description: The AI Gateway's Auto Caching feature delivers intelligent response caching for AI model interactions, automatically storing and serving frequently requested completions to dramatically reduce latency, optimise costs, and improve system performance. Organisations can achieve up to 95% latency reduction for repeated queries while maintaining response freshness and accuracy.
---

## Overview

Auto Caching represents a critical performance optimisation feature that stores AI model responses for reuse, eliminating redundant API calls to upstream providers. This caching system operates transparently across all 7 supported AI providers, ensuring consistent performance improvements regardless of the underlying model or provider.

### What Gets Cached

- **Successful Responses Only**: Only 2xx responses are cached
- **Non-Streaming Content**: Standard JSON responses (streaming excluded)
- **Complete Request Context**: Cache keys include full request body and path
- **Provider-Specific Metadata**: Model, provider, and latency information preserved


## How Auto Caching Works

### Cache Key Generation

The caching system generates unique cache keys by combining the request path with the validated request body, ensuring that identical requests receive cached responses while maintaining isolation between different queries.
