Enable advanced multi-step reasoning for more accurate and context-aware AI responses.

### Example: Complex Reasoning with Thinking Mode (Anthropic via AI Gateway)

Claude models support **thinking mode**, which enables the model to internally reason through complex problems before responding. This is ideal for use cases like optimisation, planning, and multi-step logic.

The following example shows how to invoke thinking mode through the AI Gateway using the OpenAI SDK-compatible client.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="unused-placeholder",  # Not used; authentication is handled via headers
    base_url="https://your-gateway-url/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-provider-name": "anthropic",
        "x-altrumai-key": "your-gateway-api-key"
    }
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": (
                "I have a complex problem: I need to optimise a supply chain for a company with 5 warehouses, "
"20 suppliers, and 100 retail locations. What's the best approach to tackle this optimisation problem?"
            )
        }
    ],
    temperature=1,
    max_tokens=2048,
    thinking={
        "type": "enabled",
        "budget_tokens": 1024
    }
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
