## Enhanced Policy Violation Logs in Reporting

The **Policy Violation Logs** table within the Project Reporting page has been enhanced to provide deeper insights and easier investigation of policy violations.

**What's New:**
- You can now expand any record in the Policy Violation Logs table for more details. Click the **eye icon** on a row to open a **slider panel** from the right side of the screen.
- The slider panel displays further details about the selected violation, such as:
  - Timestamp of the violation
  - Policy name and details of violation
  - User or system that triggered the violation
  - Input and output data (if available and permitted)
  - Request/Response Metadata

This enhancement enables deeper investigation and auditing of individual policy violations, helping you understand context and take appropriate action.

## User Re-Invite Functionality in Administration

Admin users with access to the Administration section can now easily re-invite users whose invitations have expired:

- In the **Users** table, any user with the status **Invited** and an expired invite will have a new option available.
- Click the **ellipsis icon** (⋯) next to the relevant user to open the action menu.
- Select **Re-invite User** to send a new invitation email directly from the table.
- This option is only visible for users who are in the **Invited** status and whose invite has expired.

This feature streamlines the process of managing user invitations and ensures that admins can quickly resend invites when needed.
