<Update label="June 2025" description="v1.0.0">
  **Enhanced Policy Violation Logs in Reporting**
  - The Policy Violation Logs table within the Project Reporting page now provides deeper insights and easier investigation of policy violations.
  - Expand any record in the Policy Violation Logs table for more details. Click the eye icon on a row to open a slider panel from the right side of the screen.
  - The slider panel displays further details about the selected violation, such as:
    - Timestamp of the violation
    - Policy name and details of violation
    - User or system that triggered the violation
    - Input and output data (if available and permitted)
    - Request/Response Metadata
  - This enhancement enables deeper investigation and auditing of individual policy violations, helping you understand context and take appropriate action.

  **User Re-Invite Functionality in Administration**
  - Admin users with access to the Administration section can now easily re-invite users whose invitations have expired.
  - In the Users table, any user with the status Invited and an expired invite will have a new option available.
  - Click the ellipsis icon (â‹¯) next to the relevant user to open the action menu.
  - Select Resend User to send a new invitation email directly from the table.
  - The Resend User option is only visible for users who are in the Invited status and whose invite has expired.
  - This feature streamlines the process of managing user invitations and ensures that admins can quickly resend invites when needed.
