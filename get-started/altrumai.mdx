# Introduction

Altrum AI combines **Advanced AI Guardrails** with the **AI Gateway** to give you **centralised control, automated compliance, and real-time risk management,** for every AI system in your enterprise.

## About AI Systems in Altrum AI

In this version of the platform, we use the term **AI System** instead of "project" - in line with the definition set out in the **EU AI Act**.

**What is an AI System?**

An **AI System** is any application, service, or tool that uses one or more AI models to generate outputs, make decisions, or assist in decision-making, regardless of whether it's built in-house, integrated from a third-party provider, or delivered through a SaaS platform.

**Examples of AI Systems in your organisation may include:**

- A customer support chatbot using a Large Language Model (LLM)
- A RAG-based assistant retrieving answers from your company's knowledge base
- An AI-powered HR helpdesk for employee queries
- A generative AI tool embedded in a SaaS product your teams use
- An agentic AI workflow that autonomously triggers business processes

**How to use AI Systems in the platform:**

- **Add an AI System** in Altrum AI for each distinct AI-enabled application or use case in your organisation.
- Each AI System can be connected via the **AI Gateway** for governance, monitoring, and guardrail enforcement.
- Policies, guardrails, and monitoring settings apply **per AI System**, giving you precise control over risks, compliance, and usage patterns.
- AI Systems can be grouped, categorised, and reported on for enterprise-wide visibility and compliance tracking.

> **Tip:** Even if multiple teams use the same underlying AI model, create separate AI Systems in the platform if the use cases, data, or compliance requirements differ. This ensures tailored governance for each context.
