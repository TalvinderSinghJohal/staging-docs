## Overview

The **Relevance Check** guardrail uses advanced AI to verify that AI-generated responses are relevant, accurate, and aligned with the user's query. It analyses both the user's input and the AI's response to ensure the content is appropriate, factual, and directly addresses the user's needs.

**Key Points:**
- Verifies response relevance and accuracy against user queries
- Prevents AI from generating off-topic or misleading information
- Uses context-aware analysis to maintain conversation quality
- Ensures responses are factual and well-supported

This ensures all AI interactions remain relevant, accurate, and trustworthy while maintaining high-quality user experiences.

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Relevance Check guardrail is to maintain high-quality AI interactions by ensuring responses are relevant, accurate, and directly address user queries while preventing the spread of misinformation or off-topic content. By enabling this guardrail, organisations can improve user satisfaction, maintain content quality, ensure factual accuracy, and uphold responsible AI usage across all interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive Relevance Analysis

The Relevance Check guardrail applies advanced content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Set Detection Threshold

Under **Set Guardrail Threshold** select the required detection sensitivity:

- **Low:** Filters only the most clearly irrelevant responses. Content with low or uncertain relevance issues is allowed.
- **Medium:** Filters responses that are likely or certainly irrelevant. Lower-confidence relevance issues are still allowed.
- **High:** Applies strict filtering—blocks any response that may be irrelevant, even with low confidence.

#### Detection Categories

The guardrail monitors multiple aspects of response quality:

- **Relevance**: Ensures responses directly address the user's query and stay on topic
- **Accuracy**: Verifies that information provided is factual and well-supported
- **Completeness**: Checks that responses provide adequate information to answer the query
- **Context**: Ensures responses maintain appropriate context and don't introduce irrelevant information
- **Misinformation**: Detects potential false or misleading information that could spread misinformation

#### Contextual Analysis

The Relevance Check guardrail performs comprehensive contextual analysis by evaluating:

- **Query Alignment**: Whether the response directly answers the user's specific question
- **Source Grounding**: Whether the response is based on available information sources
- **Factual Consistency**: Whether the response contains accurate information without introducing unverified claims
- **Contextual Relevance**: Whether the response maintains appropriate context throughout the conversation

3. Toggle the **Enable Policy** switch to **ON** to begin configuration.

---

### Step 3: Set Application Scope

1. Under **Apply Guardrail To**, choose where the policy will be enforced:
   - **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
   - **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
   - **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

---

### Step 4: Configure Enforcement Behaviour

1. Under **Select Guardrail Behaviour**, choose how the system should respond to relevance issues:

The **Relevance Check** guardrail provides enterprise-grade quality control for AI responses, ensuring your AI interactions remain relevant, accurate, and trustworthy while maintaining the highest standards of user satisfaction.

## Relevance Check Categories

The Relevance Check guardrail is designed to identify and manage various aspects of response quality. Below is an overview of the primary categories our system monitors:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Relevance | Ensures responses directly address the user's query and maintain conversation focus | User asks about product pricing, AI responds with unrelated product features |
| Accuracy | Verifies that information provided is factual and well-supported | AI provides outdated pricing information or incorrect technical specifications |
| Completeness | Checks that responses provide adequate information to answer the query | User asks for troubleshooting steps, AI provides incomplete or partial instructions |
| Context | Ensures responses maintain appropriate context and don't introduce irrelevant information | AI includes unrelated product information when user asks about a specific feature |
| Misinformation | Detects potential false or misleading information that could spread misinformation | AI provides incorrect product capabilities or false claims about features |

## Understanding Response Quality Issues

The Relevance Check guardrail evaluates responses to ensure they directly address user queries. Here are the key scenarios it detects:

### Relevant Responses
**What it is:** Responses that directly address the user's specific question and maintain conversation focus.

**Example:**
```
- **User Query:** "What are the monthly fees for a checking account?"
- **Good Response:** "The monthly fee for maintaining a checking account is $10, and there are no fees associated with opening one."
- **Why it's good:** Directly answers the question about checking account fees.
```

### Irrelevant Responses
**What it is:** Responses that don't address the user's specific question or introduce unrelated information.

**Example:**
```
- **User Query:** "What are the charges for using a checking account?"
- **Poor Response:** "The late payment fee for credit cards is 23.99%"
- **Why it's flagged:** Provides information about credit cards when the user asked about checking accounts.
```

**Another Example:**
```
- **User Query:** "How do I reset my password?"
- **Poor Response:** "Our customer service hours are Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM."
- **Why it's flagged:** Provides customer service hours instead of password reset instructions.
```

Each category is monitored with configurable sensitivity, allowing organisations to maintain appropriate quality standards while ensuring smooth user interactions. The guardrail helps create a reliable AI environment while preserving the intended functionality and trustworthiness of your automated workflows.

## Best Practices for Relevance Checking

### Optimising Response Quality

When configuring the Relevance Check guardrail, consider these best practices for optimal performance:

**Threshold Selection:**
- The guardrail generates confidence scores for both relevance and accuracy
- Higher thresholds increase the likelihood of blocking poor-quality content
- Lower thresholds allow more content through but may include lower-quality responses
- Configure thresholds between 0 and 0.99 for optimal filtering

**Application Scope:**
- Apply to **Output** for most use cases to ensure response quality
- Use **Both** for comprehensive quality control across the entire conversation
- Consider **Input** monitoring for query validation in critical applications

**Regular Review:**
- Monitor guardrail performance through the dashboard
- Review blocked responses to identify false positives
- Update configuration based on new use cases or quality requirements

**Content Evaluation:**
- The guardrail evaluates three key components: available information sources, user queries, and AI responses
- Ensure your information sources are comprehensive and up-to-date for accurate evaluation
- Consider the relationship between user questions and available information when configuring thresholds
- Monitor for patterns in blocked responses to identify potential improvements in information sources or AI training
