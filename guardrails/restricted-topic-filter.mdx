## Overview

The **Restricted Topic Filter** uses advanced AI to detect and block conversations about topics you specify, ensuring interactions stay appropriate and aligned with your organisation’s standards. Unlike simple keyword filters, it understands context and topic variations, providing accurate protection with minimal false positives.

---

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Restricted Topic Filter is to maintain conversation quality and compliance by preventing AI interactions from engaging with specified restricted topics while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organisations can ensure content appropriateness, maintain brand safety, prevent sensitive discussions, and uphold responsible AI usage across all interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive Topic Detection

The Restricted Topic Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Set Detection Threshold

Under **Set Guardrail Threshold** select the required detection sensitivity:

- **Low:** Filters only the most clearly restricted topics. Content with low or uncertain risk is allowed.
- **Medium:** Filters content that's likely or certainly restricted. Lower-confidence content is still allowed.
- **High:** Applies strict filtering blocking any content that may be restricted, even with low confidence.

## Best Practices for Topic Definition

### Creating Effective Restricted Topics

When defining restricted topics, follow these best practices for optimal detection accuracy:

**Topic Name Guidelines:**
- Use clear, concise nouns or phrases (e.g., "Investment Advice", "Cryptocurrency Trading")
- Avoid descriptive language or instructions in the name
- Keep names specific and actionable

**Topic Definition Best Practices:**
- Provide a crisp, precise definition (up to 200 characters)
- Describe the content and subtopics clearly
- Focus on what the topic encompasses, not what to block

**Example Topic Definition:**
```
Investment advice is inquiries, guidance, or recommendations about the management or allocation of funds or assets with the goal of generating returns or achieving specific financial objectives.
```


**What to Avoid:**
- Don't include instructions in definitions (e.g., "Block all cryptocurrency content")
- Don't use negative definitions (e.g., "All content except medical information")
- Don't target individual entities or words (e.g., "Statements containing competitor name X")
- Focus on themes and subjects, not specific words or entities

### Industry-Specific Examples

**Financial Services:**
```
- Topic: Investment Advice
- Definition: Guidance about managing funds, assets, or investments for financial returns
- Sample Phrases: "Should I invest in stocks?", "What's the best retirement strategy?"
```

**Healthcare:**
```
- Topic: Medical Diagnosis
- Definition: Specific medical conditions, diagnoses, or treatment recommendations
- Sample Phrases: "What disease do I have?", "Should I take this medication?"
```

**Legal Services:**
```
- Topic: Legal Advice
- Definition: Specific legal guidance, case analysis, or legal strategy recommendations
- Sample Phrases: "How should I handle this lawsuit?", "What are my legal rights?"
```

### Advanced Configuration Tips

**Contextual Understanding:**
The guardrail evaluates content contextually, not just keyword matching. This means it can detect topic variations and related discussions even when specific terms aren't used.

**Threshold Optimisation:**
- Start with **Medium** sensitivity and adjust based on testing results
- **Low** threshold for broad topic coverage with fewer false positives
- **High** threshold for precise, strict filtering of all potential violations

**Regular Review:**
- Monitor guardrail performance through the dashboard
- Review blocked content to identify false positives
- Update topic definitions based on new use cases or edge cases
