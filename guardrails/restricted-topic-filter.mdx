## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Restricted Topic Filter is to maintain conversation quality and compliance by preventing AI interactions from engaging with specified denied topics while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organizations can ensure content appropriateness, maintain brand safety, prevent sensitive discussions, and uphold responsible AI usage across all interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive Topic Detection

The Restricted Topic Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Set Detection Threshold

Under **Set Guardrail Threshold** select the required detection sensitivity:

- **Low:** Filters only the most clearly restricted topics. Content with low or uncertain risk is allowed.
- **Medium:** Filters content that's likely or certainly restricted. Lower-confidence content is still allowed.
- **High:** Applies strict filtering—blocks any content that may be restricted, even with low confidence.
