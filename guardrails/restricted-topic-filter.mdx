title: Restricted Topic Filter
description: "Advanced topic filtering that prevents AI interactions from engaging with specified denied topics while maintaining conversation quality."
---

## Overview

The **Restricted Topic Filter** uses advanced AI to detect and block conversations about topics you specify, ensuring interactions stay appropriate and aligned with your organization’s standards. Unlike simple keyword filters, it understands context and topic variations, providing accurate protection with minimal false positives.

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Restricted Topic Filter is to maintain conversation quality and compliance by preventing AI interactions from engaging with specified denied topics while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organizations can ensure content appropriateness, maintain brand safety, prevent sensitive discussions, and uphold responsible AI usage across all interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive Topic Detection

The Restricted Topic Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **User Prompts**: Analyzes incoming user content for denied topics before processing
- **AI Responses**: Evaluates generated content for inappropriate subjects before delivery
- **Context Understanding**: Considers conversation context and topic variations for more accurate detection

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Set Detection Threshold

Under **Set Guardrail Threshold** select the required detection sensitivity:

- **Low:** Filters only the most clearly restricted topics. Content with low or uncertain risk is allowed.
- **Medium:** Filters content that's likely or certainly restricted. Lower-confidence content is still allowed.
- **High:** Applies strict filtering—blocks any content that may be restricted, even with low confidence.

### Key Features

- **Custom Topic Definition**: Define any topics that need to be restricted based on organizational needs
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Advanced understanding of conversation context and topic variations
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable detection thresholds for different use cases
- **Low Latency**: High-performance detection that doesn't impact response times
- **Enterprise-Grade Accuracy**: Minimizes false positives while maintaining high detection rates
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy addition and management of custom topics as requirements change

## How to Use the Guardrail

> **Note:** The steps below guide you through configuring the Restricted Topic Filter using the Guardrail Workflow.

### Step 1: Navigate to the Guardrail Workflow

1. From the **Dashboard**, open the **Project Overview** by selecting "view" to open your project from the **Project Table**.
2. In the **guardrails** section of the Project Overview, click **Edit Guardrails** to launch the guardrail configuration workflow.

---

### Step 2: Select and Enable the Restricted Topic Filter

1. In the **Configure Guardrails** dropdown, a list of available guardrails will be displayed.
2. Click on **Topic Restriction** to open its configuration options on the right-hand side of the screen.
3. Toggle the **Enable Policy** switch to **ON** to begin configuration.

---

### Step 3: Define Valid and/or Invalid Topics

1. Under the **Topic Configuration** section, you’ll find two input fields:
   - **Valid Topics** – Enter allowed topics here. Press `Enter` after each topic to add it. These will appear as tags below the input field.
   - **Invalid Topics** – Enter restricted topics here. Press `Enter` after each entry. These will also display as tags.
2. You may configure **only Valid**, **only Invalid**, or **both**, depending on your organisation's requirements.
3. Topics can be removed by clicking the “X” on any tag.

---

### Step 4: Set Application Scope

1. Under **Apply Policy To**, choose where the policy will be enforced:
   - **Prompt** – User input only
   - **Response** – AI-generated output only
   - **Both** – Enforce on both directions

---

### Step 5: Configure Enforcement Behaviour

1. Under **Behaviour**, choose how the system should respond to restricted topics:
   - **Log Only** – Flag violations without blocking the interaction.
   - **Log and Override** – Block the prompt or response and return a smart message based on your response configuration.

---

### Step 6: Adjust Detection Threshold

1. Use the **Threshold Slider** to set how strictly topics should be matched:
   - Lower values (e.g., `0.2`) allow broader interpretation and fewer false positives.
   - Higher values (e.g., `0.9`) enforce stricter topic detection and filtering.
2. The selected threshold level will be displayed numerically alongside the slider.

---

### Step 7: Save, Test, and Apply the Policy

1. Click **Save Changes** to store your configuration settings.
2. *(Optional)* Navigate to the **Test Guardrails** tab to simulate prompts and validate guardrail enforcement live.
3. Return to the **Configure Guardrails** tab and click **Apply Guardrails** to activate the configuration.
4. A success message will confirm the guardrail has been applied to your project.
