## Overview

The **Data Protection Filter** provides comprehensive protection for personally identifiable information (PII) by leveraging advanced AI-powered detection systems to identify and safeguard sensitive data in real-time. This guardrail applies sophisticated content analysis to both user inputs and AI-generated responses, ensuring that sensitive information such as names, addresses, financial data, and other personal identifiers are properly protected.

The **Data Protection Filter** enables organizations to automatically detect and manage various forms of PII including personal identification, financial information, healthcare data, and contact details. Designed with enterprise-grade accuracy and low latency, this guardrail helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations while maintaining the integrity of AI interactions.

Unlike basic text matching, this guardrail employs advanced machine learning models that understand context, recognize patterns, and accurately identify PII even when partially obscured or formatted differently, providing comprehensive protection while minimizing false positives.
