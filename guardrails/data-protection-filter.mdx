## Overview

The **Data Protection Filter** safeguards personally identifiable information (PII) using advanced AI detection systems. It analyses both user inputs and AI responses in real-time to identify and protect sensitive data like names, addresses, and financial information.

---

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Data Protection Filter is to safeguard sensitive personal information by preventing unauthorised exposure of PII during AI interactions while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organisations can ensure compliance with data protection regulations, protect user privacy, maintain trust, and uphold responsible data handling practices across all AI-powered interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive PII Detection

The Data Protection Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Detection Categories

The guardrail monitors multiple categories of PII:

- **General**: Personal identification, contact information, and basic identifiers
- **Finance**: Financial account numbers, credit cards, and banking information
- **Technology**: Digital identifiers, network addresses, and technical credentials
- **USA Specific**: United States government and financial identifiers
- **Canada Specific**: Canadian government and healthcare identifiers
- **UK Specific**: United Kingdom government and healthcare identifiers

## Use Case: Healthcare AI Assistant

### Scenario

A healthcare organisation deploys an AI assistant to support patient enquiries and administrative tasks. The assistant must handle sensitive patient information while ensuring strict compliance with HIPAA regulations and maintaining patient privacy at all times.

### Challenge

The organisation must ensure that:

- Patient PII is never exposed in AI responses
- User inputs containing sensitive data are properly handled
- All interactions comply with healthcare privacy regulations
- Detection works accurately across various data formats and contexts

### Solution: Implementing Data Protection Filter

1. **Comprehensive Entity Selection**  
   - Selected **General** entities: Full Name, Phone Number, Email Address, Residential Address, Age
   - Selected **UK Specific** entities: U.K. NHS Number for patient identification
   - Applied to both **Input** and **Output** for full bidirectional protection

2. **Appropriate Enforcement**  
   - Set to **Block** behaviour to actively prevent PII exposure
   - Provides clear, professional fallback responses when sensitive data is detected

3. **Optimised Configuration**  
   - Used **Medium** sensitivity threshold for balanced accuracy
   - Maintains detection effectiveness across diverse data types and formats
