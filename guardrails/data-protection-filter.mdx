## Overview

The **Data Protection Filter** safeguards personally identifiable information (PII) using advanced AI detection systems. It analyses both user inputs and AI responses in real-time to identify and protect sensitive data like names, addresses, and financial information.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Multi-category PII detection** across personal, financial, and government identifiers
- **Context-aware analysis** using machine learning for accurate pattern recognition
- **Enterprise-grade accuracy** with minimal false positives
- **Regulatory compliance** with GDPR, HIPAA, and other frameworks

## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Data Protection Filter is to safeguard sensitive personal information by preventing unauthorised exposure of PII during AI interactions while maintaining high accuracy and minimal impact on legitimate business communications. By enabling this guardrail, organisations can ensure compliance with data protection regulations, protect user privacy, maintain trust, and uphold responsible data handling practices across all AI-powered interactions.

### Scope

#### Comprehensive PII Detection

The Data Protection Filter applies advanced content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.
- **Mask** – Replaces detected sensitive information with a placeholder (like [NAME]) to protect user privacy.

#### Detection Categories

The guardrail monitors multiple categories of PII:

- **General**: Personal identification, contact information, and basic identifiers
- **Finance**: Financial account numbers, credit cards, and banking information
- **Technology**: Digital identifiers, network addresses, and technical credentials
- **USA Specific**: United States government and financial identifiers
- **Canada Specific**: Canadian government and healthcare identifiers
- **UK Specific**: United Kingdom government and healthcare identifiers

### Key Features

- **Multi-Category Detection**: Comprehensive coverage across all major PII types
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Advanced understanding of conversation context and data patterns
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Adjustable detection thresholds for different use cases
- **Low Latency**: High-performance detection that doesn't impact response times
- **Enterprise-Grade Accuracy**: Minimises false positives while maintaining high detection rates
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Aligns with GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection frameworks
