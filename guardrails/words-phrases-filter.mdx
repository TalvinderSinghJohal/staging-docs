## What the Guardrail Does

### Purpose

The primary goal of the Words & Phrases Filter guardrail is to provide organisations with precise control over content by allowing them to define and block specific words, phrases, or patterns that are inappropriate, unprofessional, or non-compliant with their policies. By enabling this guardrail, organisations can maintain brand safety, ensure compliance with industry regulations, uphold professional standards, and create customised content filtering that aligns with their specific requirements.

### Scope

#### Customisable Content Filtering

The Words & Phrases Filter guardrail applies targeted content analysis to:

- **Input** – Applies the selected behaviour to what users send to the model.
- **Output** – Applies the selected behaviour to what the model returns as a response.
- **Both** – Full bidirectional coverage

#### Operational Modes

- **Monitor** – Lets you review input or output content without taking any action—used for observation and diagnostics.
- **Block** – Automatically stops content from being processed if it violates the selected guardrail rules.

#### Set Detection Threshold

Under **Set Guardrail Threshold** select the required detection sensitivity:

- **Low:** Filters only exact matches of defined words and phrases. Partial matches or similar terms are allowed.
- **Medium:** Filters exact matches and close variations of defined terms. Some contextual filtering is applied.
- **High:** Applies strict filtering—blocks exact matches, variations, and contextually similar content.

#### Filter Types

The guardrail supports multiple filtering approaches:

- **Exact Match**: Blocks specific words or phrases exactly as defined
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses patterns and wildcards for flexible filtering
- **Contextual Filtering**: Considers context when evaluating matches
- **Case Sensitivity**: Configurable case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching
- **Multi-language Support**: Filters across multiple languages and dialects
