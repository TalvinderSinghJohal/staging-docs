Welcome to the AltrumAI API – an enterprise-grade unified proxy designed to provide secure, policy-based access to leading Large Language Model (LLM) APIs and AI platforms.

The AltrumAI API acts as a centralised gateway to services including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure AI Studio, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Gemini. By leveraging advanced guardrails and enforcement mechanisms, it ensures that your organisation can safely and responsibly integrate AI capabilities while adhering to internal policies, data privacy regulations, and ethical standards.

Built for scale and flexibility, AltrumAI empowers enterprises to:

- Control access to AI services through dynamic, project-level policies in your organisation.
- Enforce compliance with data handling, audit, and usage guidelines.
- Abstract complexity by managing multiple AI providers through a single API interface.

To begin using the AltrumAI API, you’ll need a Project API Key, which must be included in the request headers. You can obtain this key by registering your AI project on the AltrumAI Platform(#).

This documentation will guide you through setup, usage, and advanced features of AltrumAI API, ensuring you can use AI responsibly across your organisation at scale.
